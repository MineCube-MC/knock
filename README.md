Why are you even using a PocketMine fork?

## Developers and API
The documentation is in my [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/MineCube-MC/Knock/wiki): it explains how to use the API to check some settings or to get the kills and the last damager, how to edit some in-game settings and even how to listen for the plugin events.
