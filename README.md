### Features
- Easy to setup
- Customizable scoretag for the players
- Arena map loading when starting the plugin
- Ingame sounds, to make the gameplay alive
- API to fully customize the game
- Customize the game settings (in-game or in the config file)

### How to setup & play
The plugin itself it's easy to setup. Follow the steps:
- Install the plugin
- Change the config values as you like
- Go to your server and type /kbffa
- Enjoy ;)

### Commands and Permissions
#### Commands
- kbffa (or knock) -> The minigame command
  - join -> Makes the player join the minigame
  - leave -> Makes the player leave the minigame
  - kills -> Check the kills of a player (can be used in console too)
  - settings -> Customize the minigame settings directly in-game
#### Permissions
- knockbackffa.customize -> Customize the minigame settings

### Troubleshooting
#### The server crashes
When you reload the server, the plugin will mess up. What you can do is to just restart the server every time you changed a configuration file.
#### Why the plugin won't work fine on X fork of PocketMine?
Why are you even using a PocketMine fork?

### Developers and API
The documentation is in my [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ApexieDevelopment/Knock/wiki): it explains how to use the API to check some settings or to get the kills and the last damager, how to edit some in-game settings and even how to listen for the plugin events.
